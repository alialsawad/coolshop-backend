- Receives as input the path to a CSV file to be imported
- A column number in which to search
- And a search key to validate against

The script must be invoked in this way (example in PHP):

```bash
$ php src/search.php ./file.csv 2 Alberto
```

Where ./file.csv is the path to a CSV file formatted in this way:

```
